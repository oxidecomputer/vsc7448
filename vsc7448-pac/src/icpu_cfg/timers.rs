For example; If a periodic interrupt is needed every 1ms, and the timer tick is generated every 100us then the TIMER_VALUE (and TIMER_RELOAD_VALUE) must be configured to 9. By default the timer will reload from the TIMER_RELOAD_VALUE when interrupt is generated, and then continue decrementing from the reloaded value.
